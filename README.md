<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# VideoDB Python SDK

VideoDB Python SDK allows you to interact with the VideoDB serverless database. Manage videos as intelligent data, not files. It's scalable, cost-efficient & optimized for AI applications and LLM integration.

<!-- Documentation -->
<!-- ## Documentation
The documentation for the package can be found [here](https://videodb.io/) -->

<!-- Installation -->

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install videodb
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Quick Start

### Creating a Connection

Get an API key from the [VideoDB console](https://console.videodb.io). Free for first 50 uploads _(No credit card required)_.

```python
import videodb
conn = videodb.connect(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Working with a Single Video

---

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Uploading a Video

Now that you have established a connection to VideoDB, you can upload your videos using `conn.upload()`.
You can directly upload from `youtube`, `any public url`, `S3 bucket` or a `local file path`. A default collection is created when you create your first connection.

`upload` method returns a `Video` object. You can simply pass a single string
representing either a local file path or a URL. The optional second positional
argument is `media_type`, keeping backwards compatibility. For explicit calls,
use the ``source`` parameter.

```python
# Upload a video by url
video = conn.upload("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDv4AWk0J3U")

# Upload a video from file system
video_f = conn.upload("./my_video.mp4")

```

### üì∫ View your Video

Once uploaded, your video is immediately available for viewing in 720p resolution. ‚ö°Ô∏è

- Generate a streamable url for the video using video.generate_stream()
- Preview the video using video.play(). This will open the video in your default browser/notebook

```python
video.generate_stream()
video.play()
```

### ‚õìÔ∏è Stream Specific Sections of Videos

You can easily clip specific sections of a video by passing a timeline of the start and end timestamps (in seconds) as a parameter.
For example, this will generate and play a compilation of the first `10 seconds` and the clip between the `120th` and the `140th` second.

```python
stream_link = video.generate_stream(timeline=[[0,10], [120,140]])
play_stream(stream_link)
```

### üîç Search Inside a Video

To search bits inside a video, you have to `index` the video first. This can be done by a simple command.
_P.S. Indexing may take some time for longer videos._

```python
video.index_spoken_words()
result = video.search("Morning Sunlight")
result.play()
video.get_transcript()
```

`Videodb` is launching more indexing options in upcoming versions. As of now you can try the `semantic` index - Index by spoken words.

In the future you'll be able to index videos using:

1. **Scene** - Visual concepts and events.
2. **Faces**.
3. **Specific domain Index** like Football, Baseball, Drone footage, Cricket etc.

### Viewing Search Results

`video.search()` returns a `SearchResults` object, which contains the sections or as we call them, `shots` of videos which semantically match your search query.

- `result.get_shots()` Returns a list of Shot(s) that matched the search query.
- `result.play()` Returns a playable url for the video (similar to video.play(); you can open this link in the browser, or embed it into your website using an iframe).

## RAG: Search inside Multiple Videos

---

`VideoDB` can store and search inside multiple videos with ease. By default, videos are uploaded to your default collection.

### üîÑ Using Collection to Upload Multiple Videos

```python
# Get the default collection
coll = conn.get_collection()

# Upload Videos to a collection
coll.upload("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsODSDmY4CY")
coll.upload("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ4kOr38JhY")
coll.upload("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uak_dXHh6s4")
```

- `conn.get_collection()` : Returns a Collection object; the default collection.
- `coll.get_videos()` : Returns a list of Video objects; all videos in the collections.
- `coll.get_video(video_id)`: Returns a Video object, corresponding video from the provided `video_id`.
- `coll.delete_video(video_id)`: Deletes the video from the Collection.

### üìÇ Search Inside Collection

You can simply Index all the videos in a collection and use the search method to find relevant results.
Here we are indexing the spoken content of a collection and performing semantic search.

```python
# Index all videos in collection
for video in coll.get_videos():
    video.index_spoken_words()

# search in the collection of videos
results = coll.search(query = "What is Dopamine?")
results.play()
```

The result here has all the matching bits in a single stream from your collection. You can use these results in your application right away.

### üåü Explore the Video object

There are multiple methods available on a Video Object, that can be helpful for your use-case.

**Get the Transcript**

```python
# words with timestamps
text_json = video.get_transcript()
text = video.get_transcript_text()
print(text)
```

**Add Subtitles to a video**

It returns a new stream instantly with subtitles added to the video.

```python
new_stream = video.add_subtitle()
play_stream(new_stream)
```

**Get Thumbnail of a Video:**

`video.generate_thumbnail()`: Returns a thumbnail image of video.

**Delete a video:**

`video.delete()`: Deletes the video.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- Adding More Indexes : `Face`, `Scene`, `Security`, `Events`, and `Sports`
- Give prompt support to generate thumbnails using GenAI.
- Give prompt support to access content.
- Give prompt support to edit videos.
- See the [open issues](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-python/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
